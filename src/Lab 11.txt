//Laboratory Exercise 11

//1.Write a program that will display the value and logical address of an integer variable 
//with an initial value of 900.

#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
  int a = 900;
  cout << "The value of a is: " << a << endl;
  cout << "The logical address of a is: " << &a << endl;
  system("pause");
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}


//2.Write a program that will display the value and logical address of an uninitialized 
//character array with size ten (10) and a pointer pointing to the array. 
//(Hint: you may need to perform some casting.)

#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
  char a[10];
  char * p;
  p = (char*) &a;
  cout << "The value of a is: " << a << endl;
  cout << "The logical address of a is: " << &a << endl;
  cout << "The value of pointer of a is: " << p << endl;
  system("pause");
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}


//3.Write a program that will display the value and logical address of an uninitialized float array 
//with size twenty (20) and a reference pointing to the array.
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>

using namespace std;

int main()
{

  cout << "The value of reference  is: " << r << endl;
